* Office

This is a minimalist package I use to sync my remote calendar and contacts with Emacs. It
depends on the excellent [[https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer][vdirsyncer]] and [[https://github.com/lucc/khard][khard]]. Calling ~office-sync~ will first update the
contacts and calendar folder, and then update the Emacs's diary[[fn:1]] and ~ecomplete~ file. To
use ~ecomplete~ when sending an email, add this to your configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(with-eval-after-load 'message
  (setq message-fill-column nil
        message-sendmail-envelope-from 'header
        message-mail-alias-type 'ecomplete
        message-self-insert-commands nil
        message-expand-name-standard-ui t)
  (ecomplete-setup))
#+end_src

Now, pressing tab on the ~to:~ field will use ~ecomplete~. This also works with ~mu4e~.

[[fn:1]] The Emacs diary is different from the org-mode diary.
